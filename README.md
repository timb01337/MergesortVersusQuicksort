This repository will contain code for the two sorting methods Mergesort and Quicksort. The two sorting algorithms will be compared in different ways and the findings will be recorded in a study paper.

The mergesort and quicksort implementations are based on w3resources guides.

Mergesort:

Quicksort:

For further comparisons the base algorithms will be adjusted.
